# Jumping-Game

This is a description about the hyper casual game, that i have developed during my third year of Bachelors. This is a fun arcade game to play along in free time. User is provided with a round shaped character. The charachter moves up in the direction and user hase to control its movements by landing on a right place by avoiding the damage. The charcter takes diamond-shaped coins as ponits. The highest number of coins will be then counted as high-score.
